HOW TO USE:
Voxelmap data merger:
Create a folder for the merging and inside that folder create a new folder for each person's data. Put the zip's containing the data of the different persons into their respective folder, which you just created. Start up the program, select Merging of Voxelmap data and then select the folder, which contains the other folders with the mapdata. The programm will automatically run , create a folder of the merged data next to the one you are merging and close once it's finished.

How to find your voxel data:
Type "%appdata%" into Windows' search and open the folder called "Roaming", which should appear. Now open .minecraft --> mods --> VoxelMods --> VoxelMap --> cache. Now select the ip of the server you are playing on and then open the folder called "Overworld (dimension 0)". Inside should be many .zip archives, that's your data.
